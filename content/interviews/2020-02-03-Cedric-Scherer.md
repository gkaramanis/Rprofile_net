#### Who are you, and what do you do?
Hi, my name is [Cédric](https://cedricscherer.netlify.com/top/about) (Twitter: @[CedScherer](https://twitter.com/CedScherer), GitHub: [Z3tt](https://github.com/Z3tt/)) and I recently finished my PhD thesis in the subject of ecology. Currently, I am working part-time as a scientific researcher at the IZW in Berlin, Germany, and as a freelancer in the field of data visualization.   

#### How do you use R? What are your favorite packages?
My first contact with R was in 2008 when doing a mathematics course in my first year as a Bachelor in Life Sciences. We had the choice between Excel/SPSS and R - the professor told us it will be harder but will help us in the future as a scientist so I trusted her and did the R version! Even though we were not really learning how to code (we had to do the exercises at the same pace as the SPSS group without any general introduction to R) I quickly realized how powerful this language and programming in general is.  

From 2010 on, I used R in several courses and projects. I've started visiting workshops dealing with R and open-source tools that mostly focussed on movement ecology and GIS. I've fallen madly in love with R in 2016 when I learned [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) (the hard way by google'n'error) and a friend showed me the versatility and opportunities of the [`tidyverse`]([`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/)) package collection.   

During my PhD, I used R for all daily-business tasks, from data wrangling (`tidyverse` packages) and anlyses ([`glmmTMB`](https://github.com/glmmTMB/glmmTMB), [`broom`](https://broom.tidyverse.org/), [`DHARMa`](http://florianhartig.github.io/DHARMa/), [`ggeffects`](https://strengejacke.github.io/ggeffects/), [`raster`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/vignettes/Raster.pdf), [`rgeos`](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/rgeos/)) to visualization (`ggplot2`, [`sf`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/), [`tmap`](https://github.com/mtennekes/tmap)). Since I've finished my PhD, I spend most of my spare time designing visualizations with `ggplot2` and its wonderful world of extension packages. So I can't name any other than `ggplot2` as my favorite! Some maybe less known packages I enjoy and use a lot are [`ggtext`](https://wilkelab.org/ggtext/) by [Claus Wilke](https://twitter.com/ClausWilke), [`ggforce`](https://ggforce.data-imaginist.com/) and patchwork by [Thomas Pedersen](https://twitter.com/thomasp85) and [`rcartocolors`](https://nowosad.github.io/rcartocolor/) by [Jakub Nowosad](https://twitter.com/jakub_nowosad). 

#### What hardware do you run R on? Do you use any other software tools?  
I work on three different machines, all running on Windows. My personal laptop (Lenovo Carbon), my work laptop (Dell XPS 13), and my personal computer in the office. Even though a lot of friends recommended to transition to Linux, I never really made the switch - but all of them have a Linux partition installed, I just need to get started with it...

#### Do you have any projects that you’re working on right now?  
I am super glad that I work with R, the `tidyverse` packages, and `ggplot2` most of my time. Currently, my work time is divided into three areas.  I am preparing the upcoming Physalia workshop ["Data Visualization in R with `ggplot2`"](https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/course56/) that I am going teach in March. I also do a lot of client projects where I analyse and visualize a variety of data sets. In my PostDoc position, I am currently writing a proposal for a personal research position. I am also more and more becoming the person to help or doing the visualizations in our lab, so I have several research projects for which I am doing collabo-work with R and `ggplot2`.  

In my spare time, when I am not spending time with my family or friends, I am also using R. I have a long list of running and potential dataviz projects and posts for my [blog](https://cedricscherer.netlify.com/). And, of course, each Tuesday evening (or a bit later), I am working on my contribution for the community challenge [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/Z3tt/TidyTuesday) - plus a few a other challenges I am participating in from time to time such as [#SWDchallenge](https://github.com/Z3tt/SWDchallenge), [#MakeoverMonday](https://github.com/Z3tt/MakeoverMonday), and the [#30DayMapChallenge](https://github.com/Z3tt/30DayMapChallenge).
