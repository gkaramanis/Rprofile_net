#### Who are you, and what do you do?

Kia Ora! My name is [Earo Wang](http://earo.me) (Twitter: [@earowang](https://twitter.com/earowang), Github: [earowang](https://github.com/earowang)). I recently move to Auckland from Melbourne, where I earned my PhD at Monash University, to take an assistant professor/lecturer position in data science at the University of Auckland (the birth place of R). I develop practical tools for data analysis and visualisation, with a focus on R.

#### How do you use R? What are your favourite packages?

R for everything?! I use R for data, data, and data. [`library(tidyverse)`](http://tidyverse.org) signals the start of my analysis. I [`usethis`](http://usethis.r-lib.org) to initialise a new package, [`roxygen2`](http://roxygen2.r-lib.org) document, and [`pkgdown`](http://pkgdown.r-lib.org) the website. When I'm not coding in `*.R`, I'm writing in `*.Rmd` for research papers with [`bookdown`](http://bookdown.org), presentation slides with [`xaringan`](https://slides.yihui.org/xaringan/), and blog posts with [`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). I cling to R for miscellaneous tasks: templating with [`whisker`](https://github.com/edwindj/whisker), bulk emailing with [`gmailr`](http://gmailr.r-lib.org), image processing with [`magick`](https://docs.ropensci.org/magick), etc.

From a developer's point of view, [`vctrs`](https://vctrs.r-lib.org) is my new favourite. The vctrs marks an incredible move towards a robust and coherent ecosystem, for not only the tidyverse but R packages in general. Package developers could focus more on new class design itself and worry less about common operations (for example, subsetting and casting). As a tidyverse user, I'm very much looking forward to the upcoming [`dplyr`](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org) `v1.0.0` that uses vctrs internally.

#### What hardware do you run R on? Do you use any other software tools?

My current setup is 2016 15-inch [MacBook Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro) at home, and the latest 16-inch edition with an external Dell monitor in the office. I have switched to macOS from Ubuntu running on Dell XPS 13 since four years ago. I have a nanode server with [linode](http://linode.com), primarily used as my DNS server. Occasionally, I login to the server to perform package checks for linux through ssh, and use R via the [Termius](https://www.termius.com) app on my iPhone. I plan to host my shiny apps on the server to make it more useful.

I spend most of my work hours with [iTerm2](http://iterm2.com) alongside [zsh](https://ohmyz.sh), where [neovim](http://neovim.io) is my workhorse for pretty much everything, including R programming. I use the [Nvim-R](https://github.com/jalvesaq/Nvim-R) plugin to talk to [radian](https://github.com/randy3k/radian) (a fully-featured R console). I switch to RStudio, when teaching and debugging. I also keep an eye on the development of [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com). [The language server protocol for R project](https://github.com/REditorSupport/languageserver) boosts loads of excitement for vscode with R.

#### Do you have any projects that youâ€™re working on right now?

I'm working on new teaching materials for a data science course, featuring the tidyverse. Some data visualisation projects will be unfolded, since we have Simon Urbanek and Paul Murrell on board.
