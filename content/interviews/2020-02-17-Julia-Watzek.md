#### Who are you, and what do you do?
Hallo! My name is [Julia Watzek](http://www.juliawatzek.com/) (Twitter: [@watzoever](https://twitter.com/watzoever), Github: [jwatzek](https://github.com/jwatzek)). I'm a cognitive & behavioral scientist wrapping up my PhD and venturing onto the job market. I study why humans and other animals make irrational decisions and how that might fit the social and physical environments we encounter. I like using data to tell stories and help people make better decisions.

#### How do you use R? What are your favorite packages?  

R and I started out as coworkers when my professor in my very first undergrad statistics class made us use it -- a sharp break from SPSS, which is usually taught in psychology. I don't know how exactly but one day I realized that base R had moved in and I was in love. R has been my go-to for data analysis ever since, and the more I learn the more I feel that anything is possible with R. [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) and the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) in general coming around was mind-blowing and I recently started contributing to [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) to practice data wrangling on different data sets than the ones I typically work with and to add more creativity to my data visualizations than academia usually allows.

Picking favorites is hard but I'll give the honor to [`beepr`](https://github.com/rasmusab/beepr), which lets you play a fun sound e.g. when your long simulation or analysis is done. It always makes me smile. My workhorse packages are the `tidyverse` collection with [`ggforce`](https://ggforce.data-imaginist.com), [`ggtext`](https://github.com/wilkelab/ggtext), [`cowplot`](https://github.com/wilkelab/cowplot), and [`patchwork`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com) among others for data viz. My data usually call for multi-level regression models, for which [`lme4`](https://github.com/lme4/lme4), [`emmeans`](https://github.com/rvlenth/emmeans), and [`rstan`](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan) are my go-tos.

#### What hardware do you run R on? Do you use any other software tools?

I do most of my work on a 2012 [MacBook Pro])(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro) and some on an old Dell tower running Windows at the office, but am looking for an excuse to run more intensive work on my friend's [Threadripper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen) build via remote access.

It's hard to beat RStudio (& [Notebooks](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-10.html)) for R and [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/index.html) (& Notebooks) for Python, but I use [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) as an IDE for everything else (and often for R and Python as well).

#### Do you have any projects that youâ€™re working on right now?

My dissertation, various side projects, and job applications! ;) I've recently done a lot more machine learning work, for which there are R packages, but I tend to use Python for this more. The [`reticulate`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) package has been amazing in letting R and Python talk to each other in the same place. When I get a chance, I want to start putting some of that work into occasional short blog posts on my website.
