It's the same four questions to everyone:

Who are you, and what do you do?  
How do you use R? What are your favorite packages?  
What hardware do you run R on? Do you use any other software tools?  
Do you have any projects that youâ€™re working on right now?  

Download a Markdown file with the questions [here](/vignette-interview.md).  
Write as long or as short answers you like, with or without links.  
Send the text with a landscape photo of you or anything you like to:
